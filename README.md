# Blue Squad Pokedex

###### Built by Ross Hazelett

## Purpose

This app was built in response to a code challenge given to me by Blue Squad.
In short, the app needed to do the following:

1. Interact with a third party Api called Pokeapi and return data on certain pokemon
2. Include a method for searching for a pokemon
3. Have an interface that displays a pokemon's stats and picture on a "card"
4. Allow users to click forward and backward to iterate to the next or previous pokemon

## Technology

- The entire client was built in React
- I primarily used functional components rather than classes and used Hooks extensively
- I used Flexbox for arranging components. It's a simple solution and I use it on nearly every project.
- The JavaScript Client provides the front end UX for users to access the application

## Features and Design

- I chose not to use any CSS libraries and built the overall design from scratch. Many libraries are too slick or clean for what I wanted, and as Pokemon is a playful and wholesome franchise I wanted the design to feel playful and sort of cartoony, with simplicity and bright colors in mind.
- I eyedropped colors from the Pokemon logo, pokeball, and pokeapi website to create a consistent and recognizable color scheme.
- The landing page is a simple call to action with a search bar allowing users to search for a Pokemon either by name or by number.
- After a user has searched for a pokemon the search bar fades in on the navbar and remains there until the page is refreshed, allowing the user to either iterate through Pokemon using the arrow buttons, or make another search from the nav.
- I included a message in the bottom left about the app being powered by Pokeapi and the logo is a link to the pokeapi site.

## To Test Solution

1. I deployed this app to Netlify and you can find it at this link [here](https://bluesquad-pokedex-ross-hazelett.netlify.app/)
2. I copied my files to a codesandbox so you can click through and look at the code as well [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/blue-squad-pokedex-9x03y).
3. [Here](https://github.com/noobiwankenoobi/blue-squad-pokedex-v01) is a link to my github repo for the project.
